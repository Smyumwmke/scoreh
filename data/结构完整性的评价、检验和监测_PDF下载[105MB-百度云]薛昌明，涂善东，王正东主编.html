FM2008 is held in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province from October 31 to November 5,2008. The first FM conference was held in 2003 at East China University of Science and Technology,Shanghai. Since then, the FM annual meetings have taken place at different cities and regions. This includes FM2004 in Huangshan, Anhui Province, FM2005 in Zhengzhou, Henan province, FM2006 in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province and FM2007 in Changsha, Hunan province. These annual events are indicative of the fact that the FM symposium series has played an important role in promoting information exchange, inspiring new ideas, integrating practical and research findings and breaking new grounds for the young generation.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
