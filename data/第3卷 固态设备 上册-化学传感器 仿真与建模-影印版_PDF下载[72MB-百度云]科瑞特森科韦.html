For a long time he was a leader of the scientific Gas Sensor Group and manager of various national and international scientific and engineering projects carried out in the Laboratory of Micro- and Optoelectronics, Technical University of Moldova. Currently, Dr. Korotcenkov is a research professor at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Republic of Korea.
　　Specialists from the former Soviet Union know Dr. Korotcenkov's research results in the field of study of Schottky barriers, MOS structures, native oxides, and photoreceivers based on Group IIIH-V compounds very well. His current research interests include materials science and surface science, focused on nanostructured metal oxides and solid-state gas sensor design. Dr. Korotcenkov is the author or editor of 11 books and special issues, 11 invited review papers, 17 book chapters, and more than 190 peer-reviewed articles. He holds 18 patents, and he has presented more than 200 reports at national and international conferences.
　　Dr. Korotcenkov's research activities have been honored by an Award of the Supreme Council of Science and Advanced Technology of the Republic of Moldova (2004), The Prize of the Presidents of the Ukrainian, Belarus, and Moldovan Academies of Sciences (2003), Senior Research Excellence Awards from the Technical University of Moldova (2001, 2003, 2005), a fellowship from the International Research Exchange Board (1998), and the National Youth Prize of the Republic of Moldova (1980), among others.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
