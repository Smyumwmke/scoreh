   Tales
from Shakespeare is an English children’s book written by Charles Lamb and his
sister Mary Lamb in 1807. The book is designed to make the stories of Shakespeare’s
plays familiar to the young. However, as noted in the author’s Preface, “[Shakespeare’s]
words are used whenever it seemed possible to bring them in; and in whatever
has been added to give them the regular form of a connected story, diligent
care has been taken to select such words as might least interrupt the effect of
the beautiful English tongue in which he wrote: therefore, words introduced
into our language since his time have been as far as possible avoided.”
   Mary
Lamb was responsible for the comedies, while Charles wrote the tragedies; they
wrote the preface between them. The book has been republished many times. It
was illustrated by Sir John Gilbert (1866), Arthur Rackham (1899,1909), Louis Monziès
in (1908), Walter Paget (1910), D. C. Eyles (1934, 1938).
