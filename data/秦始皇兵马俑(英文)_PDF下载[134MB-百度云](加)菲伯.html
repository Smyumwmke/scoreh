Emperor of Stone: Qin and the Terra Cotta Armies takes a detailed look at Qin's major accomplishments, achievements whose long shadow through time continue to shape China today. But the book does more.

Chopsticks and fortune cookies.<br/>But when l moved to Beijing to teach in 2001- and 1earned that there are no fonune cookies there-I  began my love affair wim China.The next year I was invited to Shanghai Maritime University；it was the beginning of six memorable years of teaching writing and English. What’s more.when I participated in a transition of Margaret Atwood’s Blind Assassin. I was foreed to reconsider the magnifieence of language with new eyes.<br/>As well, my wife and I traveled widely-from Xinjiang and Tibet in the west，to Inner Mongolia， in the north，Qingdao in the east and Hong Kong， Guangzhou，and Haifian in the south. Everywhere， we were dazzled by the beauty and diversity of the culture, and all under one roof！<br/>But the heart of this rich mystery of a country is in Xi’an.I made four trips to the museum there.each one a journey in time and space.<br/>In order to understand a thing.1 write about it. To enable my western mind to understand eastern culture-how people can bend for twelve hours a day seven days a week growing rice-I wrote. I have contributed articles on culture，health，travel，media and translation to that's Shanghai and Shanghsi Talk. One of those articles，in fact，on Oin Shi Huang and the terra cotta wardors. led me to the wrign of Emperor of Stone. Qin andthe Terra Cotta Armies.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
