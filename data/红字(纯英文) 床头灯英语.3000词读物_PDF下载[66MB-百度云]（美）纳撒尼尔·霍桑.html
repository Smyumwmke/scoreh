"This woman has brought shame to our community， and should die. Is there no law for it? Of course there is in the words of God."　　"Be quiet， now， foolish women!" exclaimed a man in the crowd. "The prison door is opening， and here comes Mistress Prynne herself."　　The door of the prison sprang open， and there appeared， like a black shadow coming into the　　sunshine， the prison guard， with a sword at his side.This person represented the strictness of Puritan law， which it was his duty to give the final punishment to the criminals. He carried his sword in his left hand， and laid his right hand on the shoulder of a young woman， who he dragged forward. At the doorway to the prison， she resisted him， showing her 'oravery and independence， as she stepped into the sunlight. She held a child， a baby of three　　months old， who turned its head from the light. The baby's life had， until then， been only in the dark  prison， it had never seen the light of day.　　When the young woman-the mother of this child-stood in front of the crowd， she held the baloy close to her chest， not to show motherly love，but to hide her sign of punishment. In a moment，however， she showed the front of her dress to the waiting crowd. They soon viewed an elegantly sewn letter "A，" which was artistically done in fine red cloth surrounded by rich gold thread.The rare piece showed a great amount of skill，which Hester had done herself. The elegant piece was of much greater quality than was allowed in the town.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>海丝特因犯通奸罪而受到教会惩罚，却坚决不肯说出孩子的父亲是谁。7年过去了，她用善行赢得了人们的尊敬，使胸前那本来代表耻辱的红字变成了美好德行的象征，而经过多年的窥探，海丝特的丈夫齐灵渥斯发现与妻子通奸的原来是“品德高尚”的牧师。对齐灵渥斯的恐惧和隐瞒罪责的煎熬使牧师的健康每况愈下。在生命的很后时刻，他终于在全体信徒面前，用以生命为代价的忏悔换取了道德上的新生。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
