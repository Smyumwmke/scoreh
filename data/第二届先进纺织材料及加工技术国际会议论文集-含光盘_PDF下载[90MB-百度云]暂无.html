  插图：1 IntroductionThe gaseous ammonia is generated by a continuous decomposition of antifreeze admixtures based onurea compounds in the concrete wall under alkaline and warm condition, and then release to indoorenvironment through slow diffusion and have led to the increasing indoor air pollutiontll. There fore, how to reduce the risk caused by ammonia in indoor air becomes a big issue in some countries particularly China. In recent years, several studies involved in the decomposition of indoor ammonia with nano-TiO2 loaded woven fabrics as the photocatalysts have been reported. However, it is known that some disadvantages such as higher cost hindered the nano-TiO2 particles from using as the photocatalyst in an industrial scale. Hence, it is necessary to explore new catalysts for the decomposition of indoor ammonia by using lower-cost polymer materials. Fe (III)-modified polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber complexes have been used as a low-cost and effective heterogeneous Fenton catalyst in the decomposition of textile dyes in wastewater since they could enhance the decomposition of H202 into hydroxyl radicals with high oxidative power. In this work, the Fe-(III)-amidoximated PAN fiber complexes (Fe-AO-PAN) were firstly prepared and expected to serve as the catalyst for the oxidation of ammonia in indoor air. And some important effecting factors such as catalyst dosage, Fe content of the catalyst, initial ammonia concentration and gas flow rate were investigated and discussed.2 Experimental methods2.1 Materials and reagentsAcrylic knitting yams consisted of twisted acrylic fibers containing 87.07% acrylonitrile monomer are purchased from Kunshan Shilin Woolen Spinning Company (Shanghai, China).
