this book provides the most basic combinatorial problems and well-established theory in design and analysis of the topological structure of interconnection networks in the graph-theoretic language.it covers the basic methods of network design,several well-known networks such as hypercubes,de bruijn digraphs,kautz digraphs,double loop,and the newest parameters to measure performance of networks such as forwarding indices of a routing,menger number,rabin number,fault-tolerant diameter,wide-diameter,generalized dominating number,and restricted connectivity.it will be of significant interest to researchers and practitioners working in design and analysis of networks,particularly to undergraduates and postgraduates specializing in computer science and applied mathematics.
