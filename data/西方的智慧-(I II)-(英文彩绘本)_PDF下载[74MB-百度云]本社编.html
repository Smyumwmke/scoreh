                                        　　《西方的智慧(英文彩绘本)(套装全2册)》："a big book," said callimachus the
alexandrianpoet, "is a big evil！" on the whole i feel inclined
toshare this view. if, therefore, i venture to put thepresent
volume before the reader, it is because, asevils go, this book is a
minor one. nevertheless, it calls for a specialexplanation; for i
have some time ago written a book on the samesubject. wisdom of the
west is an entirely new work; though, ofcourse, it would never have
appeared had not my "history of westernphilosophy" preceded
it.
　　what are philosophers doing when they are at work？ this is
indeedan odd question, and we might try to answer it by first
setting out whatthey are not doing. there are, in the world around
us, many thingswhich are understood fairly well. take, for
instance, tile working of asteam engine. this falls within the
fields of mechanics andthermodynamics. again, we know quite a lot
about the way in whichthe human body is built and functions.
　　in graeco-roman times, as today, philosophy was in the main
independent from religion.philosophers might, of course, ask
questionswhich would also be of interest to those whowere concerned
with religious matters. butpriestly organisations had no influence
on, orpower over, the thinkers of those times. theintervening
period from the fall of rome tothe end of the middle ages differs
in thisrespect from both the preceding andsubsequent eras.
philosophy in the westbecame an activity which flourished under
thepatronage and direction of the church. forthis there are a
number of reasons. when the western roman empire brokeup, the
function of the god-emperors ofrome had already been split into two
powers.
　　哲学与历史、政治与宗教、科学与蒙昧，它们或互为表里、或相反相成。只有独具慧眼才能揭示其中的真理之光。从希腊城邦、罗马帝国.到文艺复兴以迄于今的西方文化的昌明；从苏格拉底、柏拉图、亚里士多德，到康德、黑格尔、尼采，这是一条绵延不绝的智慧与思想的长河。

1900s and is consideredone of the founders of analytic
philosophyalong with his protege Wittgenstein and hiselder Frege.
