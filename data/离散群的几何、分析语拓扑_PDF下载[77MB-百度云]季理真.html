      Discrete subgroups F of Lie groups G are foundational objects in modern<br/>
mathematics and occur naturally in different subjects. For example, integers form<br/>
a discrete subgroup Z of the Lie group R. They give rise to actions on homoge-<br/>
neons spaces associated with the Lie groups G. These actions of F can be used to<br/>
study the discrete groups F and are also interesting on their own. For example,<br/>
when G is a noncompact semisimple Lie group, there is an associated Rieman-<br/>
nian symmetric space X = G/K, and the quotient FX is a locally symmetric<br/>
space, which is special Riemannian manifolds and often occur as moduli spaces in<br/>
algebraic geometry and number theory.<br/>
      To understand better the structures and applications of discrete subgroups of<br/>
Lie groups and locally symmetric spaces, an instructional conference titled Geom-<br/>
etry~ Topology and Analysis of Locally Symmetric Spaces and Discrete Groups was<br/>
held from July 17 to August 4, 2006 at the Morningside Center of Mathematics in<br/>
Beijing. The conference consisted of lecture series and research talks by experts<br/>
around the world. This proceedings contains expanded lecture notes and related<br/>
papers of some of the talks on the conference. These papers cover many topics re-<br/>
lated to the themes of this conference, such as algebra, analysis, geometry, number<br/>
theory and topology. We would like to thank all the speakers for their stimulating<br/>
talks and especially for the authors of the papers included in this book for their<br/>
efforts in writing up their lecture notes. We hope that they will present a global<br/>
perspective on the beautiful subjects around discrete subgroups of Lie groups and<br/>
locally symmetric spaces.<br/>
      This three-week long conference was generously funded by the Morningside<br/>
Center of Mathematics, and also partially sponsored by the Higher Education<br/>
Press in China and the journal Pure and Applied Mathematics Quarterly.  We<br/>
would like to thank the staff members of the center, in particular Xiaoning Li,<br/>
and the secretaries of the journal, in particular Chen Fang, for their devoted help<br/>
before and during the conference. Without them, this conference could not run<br/>
smoothly.<br/>
