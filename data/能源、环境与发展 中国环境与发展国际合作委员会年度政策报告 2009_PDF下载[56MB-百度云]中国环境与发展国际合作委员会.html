Additional attention to environmental man- agement is required along the entire coal value chain. Key areas for improvement of standards include: coal mine closure and land-subsidence management and land and water contamination, proper recovery and use of fly ash and gangue, and other valuable byproducts; coal washing in relation to thermal coal specifications; extension of existing emissions standards in power plants to include mercury, and volatile organic com- pounds （VOCS）. As well there is a need to establish local carrying capacity assessments that may lead to restrictions on coal mining or use based on water conditions, and to set out regional caps on air pollutants.（6） In heavily polluting situations, and based on the requirement of total emission control, estabfish pilot efforts for regional controls on total coal consumption, and strengthen pollution supervision for coal- fired power plants. China should develop coal consumption assessment standards based on regional environmental capacity, and implement total allowable coal consumption adjustment based on the requirement of total emission control in areas with significant air pollution, such as the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta and Beijing TianjinHebei region; implement simultaneous control of multiple pollutants, based on establishing systematic and scientific air quality standards and emission standards; develop a national clean air action plan, focusing on main issues in the next 20-30 years such as urban air quality, combined air pollution, regional air pollution and GHG emissions, etc.; strength- en enforcement of desulphurization in coal- fired power plants, and promote application of denitrification technology and improve emission standards; further reform and im- prove the pollution fee system and environ- mental subsidies f</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
