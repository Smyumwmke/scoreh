<table width="100%"><tr><td>    More than ever, today's students are "consumer-oriented," due in part to the changing world economy that promotes quality, competition, and professional currency. They expect to way from a course with more than a grade and a promise that they'll someday appreciate what they've learned. They want to "practice" the applications of concepts. As with the previous editions of this book , we wrote it to: (1)balance the coverage of concepts, tools, techniques, and their application, (2)provide the most examples of system is and design deliverables available in any book, and (3)balance the coverage of classical methods (such as structured analysis and information engineering) and emerging methods (e.g., object-oriented analysis and rapid application development). Additionally, we wrote the textbook to serve the reader as a post-course, professional reference for best current practices.</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td>　　</td></tr></table>

</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>世界经济的快速发展促进了质量提高、竞争加剧以及职业的流动。学生们要满足社会的发展，不仅需要学习原理的应用知识，更需要学习如何将原理用于实践。本书的前几个版本强调以下三点：（1）覆盖了相关的原理，工具，技术及其实现；（2）提供了大量的系统分析与设计的例子；（3）覆盖了传统（如结构化的分析和信息工程）与现代（面向对象的分析和快速应用开发）的方法。本书采用“与你说，而不是对你说”的叙述语气，延续了前四版一贯的生动、交流式的风格，因而易于为读者接受。 本书适合作为高等院校信息系统或商业类专业本科或研究生教材，亦适合于作为系统开发人员的参考书。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
