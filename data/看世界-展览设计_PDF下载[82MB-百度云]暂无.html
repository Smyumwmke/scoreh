     "see the world - exhibition
design(fine)"(the shenzhen city arts and cultural development
company limited) in light of these comments is really an excellent
resource. a vast range of design display projects that have
successfully had to come to terms with these issues in varying
ways. all the projects presented here reflect a truly amazing range
of vocabularies and ideas. in this way we can see the richness of
different possibilities that have been taken, cross reference of
them, see how they have been made, lit etc.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
