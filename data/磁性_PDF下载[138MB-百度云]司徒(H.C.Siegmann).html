  《磁性》主要内容简介：This book emerged from a close collaboration of the authors which started inthe fall of 2000. Early that year one of us （J.S.） had joined the Stanford facultyafter spending nearly 15 years at the IBM Almaden Research Center and theother （H.C.S.） had just retired from a chair at the ETH Ziirich and come toStanford as a visiting professor.</p>]<p><h2>相关资料</h2></p>[<p>
  插图：atomic level. The seminal contribution of neutron techniques to magnetismis reflected by the October 1994 press release by the Royal Swedish Academyof Sciences on the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physics, won by Bertram N. Brockhouse（1918-2003） and Clifford G. Shull （1915-2001）, "Neutrons are small magnets,as are the atoms of a magnetic material. When a neutron beam strikes suchmaterial, the neutrons can therefore change direction through magnetic inter-action with the atoms of the material. This gives rise to a new type of neutrondiffraction which can be used to study the relative orientations of the smallatomic magnets. Here, too, the X-ray method has been powerless and in thisfield of application neutron diffraction has since assumed an entirely dominantposition. It is hard to imagine modern research into magnetism without thisaid."At the time of this press release efforts were already underway to changethe role of X-rays in magnetism. This relatively recent and important deve-lopment will be discussed later. The last 30 years have seen another importantdevelopment, the generation and manipulation of spin polarized electrons [45].This development has culminated in phenmena .like giant magnetoresistanceand "spintronics". We shall see later that studies by means of polarized elec-trons and X-rays have provided important new information. Today one couldrephrase the last sentence of the above quote by the Nobel Prize Commit-tee: It is hard to imagine modern research into magnetism without polarizedelectron and X-ray probes.</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>this book emerged from a close collaboration of the authors which started inthe fall of 2000. early that year one of us （j.s.） had joined the stanford facultyafter spending nearly 15 years at the ibm almaden research center and theother （h.c.s.） had just retired from a chair at the eth ziirich and come tostanford as a visiting professor.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
