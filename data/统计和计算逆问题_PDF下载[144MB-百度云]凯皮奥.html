<p>书名:统计和计算逆问题</p><p>作者:凯皮奥</p><p>页数:339</p><p>定价:¥39.0</p><p>出版社:世界图书出版公司</p><p>出版日期:2015-01-01</p><p>ISBN:9787510086311</p><p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　This book is aimed at postgraduate students in applied mathematics as well as at engineering and physics students with a firm background in mathematics. The first four chapters can be used as the material for a first course on inverse problems with a focus on computational and statistical aspects. On the other hand, Chapters 3 and 4, which discuss statistical and nonstationary inversion methods, can be used by students already having knowldege of classical inversion methods.　　There is rich literature, including numerous textbooks, on the classical aspects of inverse problems. From the numerical point of view, these books concentrate on problems in which the measurement errors are either very small or in,which the error properties are known exactly. In real world problems, however, the errors are seldom very small and their properties in the deterministic sense are not well known. For example, in classical literature the error norm is usually assumed to be a known real number. In reality, the error norm is a random variable whose mean might be known.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
