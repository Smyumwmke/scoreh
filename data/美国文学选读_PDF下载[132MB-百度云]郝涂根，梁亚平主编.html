<p>书名:美国文学选读</p><p>作者:郝涂根，梁亚平主编</p><p>页数:383</p><p>定价:¥48.0</p><p>出版社:安徽大学出版社</p><p>出版日期:2013-08-01</p><p>ISBN:9787566406187</p><p><h2>节选</h2></p>[<p>　　About the Author　　Thoreau was born in Concord，a village near Boston where many of theliterarv figures of the century，including Emerson，lived．Aftergraduating from Harvard and in a school for a few years，Thoreau went tolive with Emerson both to study with him and to work as a handyman．Laterin his life he traveled a little，but in general Thoreau stayed near his home．He had a strong attachment to his family，and he preferred to travel throughbooks．The trips he did take were often camping trips，for he enj oyed theoutdoors and was a skillful woodsman．　　Both Thoreau’s Transcendental philosophy and his scientific knowledgecontributed to his love of nature．In A Week on the Concord and MerrimackRivprs，he wrote about a canoeing trip he made with his brother．Later hebuilt himseIf a cabin in the woods by Walden Pond，and lived there for twoyears，reporting on his experiences in Walden．He wanted to live alone andto depend on his own mental and physical resources．He raised his own foodand spent very little money，devoting most of his time to study andreflection．　　Thoreau’s style is often conversational in tone，similar to that found inEmerson’siournals，so on the surface his books seem to be nothing morethan casual accounts of his trips．  In fact，however，their carefully arrangeddesign helps to convey Thoreau’s meaning．　　Waldenis deceptively casual．Thoreau condensed his two and a halfyears in the woods into one year，stressing the unifying theme of seasonalchanges as he progressed from the summer growth of his bean crop to itsharvest，and to the death of the plants and replanting in the spring．Thoreauused the little world around Walden Pond to illustrate his philosophy andobservations about 1ire．　　Through his writing Thoreau wanted to illustrate that the pursuit ofmaterial things had no value．He desired a life of contemplation，of being inharmony with nature，and of acting on his own principles．　　……</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
