     The book is written based on the Textile Readers (second edition). It is<br/>
used for the college students majoring in textiles and related majors. The<br/>
context is carefully selected mainly from books and journals published in the<br/>
United States and the United Kingdom. Each text reads easily and smoothly<br/>
with standard expressions. The book covers fibers, yams, fabrics, textile<br/>
dyeing and finishing, nonwovens, fashion, composites, and new textile<br/>
technology is also included, which reflects the newest development in the<br/>
textile field. It is revised based on the suggestions raised from different<br/>
readers. Words selected in the book are sufficient for daily use on textile<br/>
communication.<br/>
    Although the book is prepared for the college students, it can also be used<br/>
as training materials for enterprises. Those who are interested in the textiles<br/>
may use the book as reference.<br/>
    All suggestions for improvement are cordially welcome.<br/>

            Some Considerations in Sizing<br/>
     For a size formula to approach perfection in a given application, it should have several basic<br/>
characteristics which will serve to eliminate warp breaks during weaving. Defects in the warp yam<br/>
such as knots, crossed ends, slubs, weak spots, etc., must be overcome as much as possible by the<br/>
size film. Even the strongest of warp yams, such as filament nylon, and even woven wire will<br/>
kink and encounter quality problems. For the size fdm to accomplish its primary tasks one would<br/>
have to consider the following:.<br/>
Tensile strength<br/>
     The tensile strength of the yam must be increased by the fiber-to-fiber cementing of the size<br/>
film, as well as by the addition of the strength of the film itself.<br/>
     Logically, the greater the increase in tensile strength, the less likelihood there will be of a<br/>
break occurring, particularly where weak places are excessive.<br/>
Adhesion<br/>
     Adhesion is not only necessary in the fiber-to-fiber cementing, but also important to assure<br/>
that the film formed by the size formula will adhere to the fiber substrate and protect the warp<br/>
yam in the weaving operation.<br/>
Flexibility<br/>
     This property is particularly important in weaving. Sized warp yams must be able to<br/>
withstand repeated and extensive bending in the weaving operation without damage to the size<br/></p>]
