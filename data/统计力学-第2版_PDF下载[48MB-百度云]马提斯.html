typos corrected and figures added， some in response to many helpful
comments on the first edition. we especially thank professor milton
w. cole for his correction of a factor 2 in the specific heat of a
1d hard-core bose gas. additionally， solutions to some
representative problems have been included in an appendix.<br/>
　　but， more t.han mere revision and expansion of the material， it
is the wit and knowledge of a new co-author that has greatly
improved the present text. thanks to this couaboration the topics
of renormalization group and monte-carlo numerical techniques could
be treated on a par with more conventional elements of statistical
thermodynamics. the addition of these important subjects and the
expansion of topics that previously had been just many-body theory
and phase transitions. we present this new edition in the hope it
will better serve the contemporary student while offering to the
instructor a wider， more useful choice of lecture materials.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
