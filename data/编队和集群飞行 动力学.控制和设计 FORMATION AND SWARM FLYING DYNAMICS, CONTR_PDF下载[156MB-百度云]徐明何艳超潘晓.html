The aim of this book is to introduce the novel approaches for the study ofrelative dynamics modelling, control, and design of formation and swarm flying.Broad research focuses of current interest are covered, with each chapter involvedin different topics. The contents of this book include the introduction, definition,and property of orbital mechanics and control system in the framework offormation and swarm flying concepts using various theoretical methods andnumerical simulations, which have potential merits in mission analysis and design.     The book is intended for researchers, teachers, and students of the universitiesand institutes in astrodynamics, control, and interdisciplinary space technologyfields for the purpose of academic study and engineering application.
