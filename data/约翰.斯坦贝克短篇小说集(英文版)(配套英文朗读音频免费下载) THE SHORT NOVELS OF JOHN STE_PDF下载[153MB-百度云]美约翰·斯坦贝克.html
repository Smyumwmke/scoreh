   Steinbeck’s novels can all be classified as social novels dealing with the economic problems of rural labour, but there is also a streak of worship of the soil in his books. After the rough and earthy humor of Tortilla Flat, he moved on to more serious fiction, often aggressive in its social criticism. In 1936 In Dubious Battle was published. This was followed by Of Mice and Men, and a series of admirable short stories collected in The Long Valley. In 1939 he published what is considered his best work, The Grapes of Wrath. Among his later works should be mentioned East of Eden, The Winter of Our Discontent, and Travels with Charley.
    John Steinbeck was awarded The Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, “for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic humour and keen social perception.”
