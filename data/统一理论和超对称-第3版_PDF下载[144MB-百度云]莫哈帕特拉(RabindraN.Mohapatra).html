  插图：three-quark bound states, whereas meson spectroscopy arises from nonrela tivistic quark-antiquark bound states. Accepting quarks as the constituents of hadrons, we have to search for a field theory that provides the bindingforce between the quarks.In trying to understand the Fermi statistics for baryons （such as ）, itbecame clear that if they are S-wave bound states, then the space part oftheir wave function is totally symmetric; since a particle such as  consists of three strange quarks, and has spin 3/2, the spin part of its wave functionis symmetric. If there were no other degree of freedom, this would be indisagreement with the required Fermi statistics. A simple way to resolvethis problem is to introduce [11] a threefold degree of freedom for quarks,called color （quarks being color triplets） and assume that all known baryonsare singlet under this new SU（3）. Since an SU（3）c-singlet constructed outof three triplets is antisymmetric in the interchange of indices （quarks）, thetotal baryon wave function is antisymmetric in the interchange of any twoconstituents as required by Fermi statistics.It is now tempting to introduce strong forces by making SU（3）c into alocal symmetry. In fact, if this is done, we can show that exchange of theassociated gauge bosons provides a force for which the SU（3）c color singletis the lowest-lying state; and triplet, sextet, and octet states all have highermass. By choosing this mass gap large, we can understand why excitedstates corresponding to the color degree of freedom have not been found.While this argument in favor of an SU（3）c gauge theory of strong inter-action was attractive, it was not conclusive. The most convincing argumentin favor of SU（3）c gauge theory came from the experimental studies of deepinelastic neutrino and electron scattering off nucleons. These experimentsinvolved the scattering of very-high-energy （E） electronsand neutrinoswith the exchange of very high momentum transfers （i.e., q2 large）. It wasfound that the structure functions, which are analogs of form factors forlarge q2 and E, instead of falling with q2, became scale-invariant functionsdepending only on the ratio q2/2mE. This was known as the phenomenonof scaling [12]. Two different theoretical approaches were developed to un-derstand this problem. The first was an intuitive picture called the partonmodel suggested by Feynman [13] and developed by Bjorken and Paschos[14], where it was assumed that, at very high energies, the nucleon can bethought of as consisting of free pointlike constituents. The experimentalresults also showed that these pointlike constituents were spin-l/2 objects,like quarks, and the scaling function was simply the momentum distri-bution function for the partons inside the nucleon. These partons couldbe identified with quarks, thus providing a unified description of the nu-cleon as consisting of quarks at low, as well as at high, energies. The maindistinction between these two energy regimes uncovered by deep inelas-tic scattering experiments is that at low energies the forces between thequarks are strong, whereas at high energies the forces vanish letting thequarks float freely inside the nucleons.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
