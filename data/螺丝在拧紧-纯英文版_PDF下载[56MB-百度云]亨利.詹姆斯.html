It filled me with all kinds of hope for the future. I was very eager about meeting the boy the following day. However， something happened that evening that made me less comfortable with the situation.　　Before dinner， Mrs. Grose gave me a letter from the boy's school. Although， she had not read it， she did not seem happy that it had come. "It's from the leader of his school. A very unpleasant and boring man！ I have no interest at all in what he has to say about our boy， Miles！"　　I took the envelope upstairs to my bedroom and， after changing into my evening bedclothes， opened it. As soon as I read it， I wished that I had waited until the next morning to open it. It made me very upset and I could not sleep the whole night. The next day， I decided to go to Mrs. Grose first in the morning and share the news with her.　　"The school will no longer accept Miles as their student."　　"Are you sure about this?" she asked. "The school always sends the children home during holiday."　　"It's very clear in the letter that he is never to return to the school，" I said.　　Her eyes then became watery. "Why would they do this? Has he one something wrong?"　　I held out the letter to her to take and read herself， but she would not accept it. "I'm sorry， ma'am， but I don't want to read it."　　I realized then that Mrs. Grose was not able to read！ I felt guilty for having embarrassed her. In order to avoid further uncomfortable feelings I asked， "What sort of child is Miles? Is he a good boy?"　　"What does the school say， exactly，" she asked， her eyes still red and full of water.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《螺丝在拧紧》是美国乃至世界文学史上的大文豪亨利·詹姆斯（小说界的莎士比亚）的传奇作品，是有史以来恐怖的鬼故事之一，不仅受到了西方读者的热烈欢迎，还不断地进入英美的剧场和课堂。　　圣诞前夜，几个朋友围坐炉旁打发时光，百无聊赖地讲起了他们听到的鬼故事。一个关于小孩遇见鬼的故事引起了老者道格拉斯的兴趣，于是他在几天后的晚上讲述了一个深埋多年的恐怖故事。年轻淳朴的女教师受托到英国一座古老静谧的庄园看护一对聪颖俊秀、天真无邪的兄妹。不料，庄园中的静谧很快被打破：塔楼上的神秘男子、楼梯上的幽灵、湖岸边的人影……这一切究竟是盥灵、幻影，还是心魔？鬼影幢幢的庄园内，螺丝在拧紧。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
