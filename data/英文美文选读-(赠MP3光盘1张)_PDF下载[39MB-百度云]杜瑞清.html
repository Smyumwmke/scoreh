  插图：Genres and functions of Essays It is difficult to define the genre into which essays fall. Huxley arguesthat essays can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame ofreference: the pole of the personal and the autobiographical, the pole ofthe objective, the factual and the concrete-particular, and the pole of theabstract-universal. Based on this, essays fall into a variety of categories. The first is Personal Essay, which is created by essayists who writefragments of reflective autobiography and look at the world through thekeyhole of anecdote and description. The second is Objective Essay whichis produced by essayists who do not speak directly of themselves, but turntheir attention outward to some literary or scientific or political themes.And the third, the most richly satisfying genre of essays, combines bothpersonal and objective into one.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
