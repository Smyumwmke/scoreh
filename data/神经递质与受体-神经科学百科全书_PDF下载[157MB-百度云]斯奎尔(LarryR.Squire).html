  插图：For many years, the understanding of neurotransmis-sion has been dominated by the concept that oneneuron releases only a single transmitter, known as'Dale's Principle.' This idea arose from a widelyadopted misinterpretation of Dale's suggestion in1935 that the same neurotransmitter was stored inand released from all terminals of a single neuron, asuggestion which did not specifically preclude thepossibility that more than one transmitter may beassociated with the same neuron. Several lines of evi-dence emerged which were inconsistent with the sin-gle transmitter concept, and it is now known thatindividual neurons contain and can release a largenumber and variety of substances which are capableof influencing target cells. This phenomenon of'cotransmission' is widespread, involving virtuallyall known transmitter systems.  Early hints of cotransmission came in the 1950swith evidence for the involvement of both noradren-aline （NA） and acetylcholine （ACh） in sympathetictransmission. Koelle identified acetylcholinesterase insome adrenergic neurons in 1955, while Burn andRand introduced the concept of a 'cholinergic' linkin adrenergic transmission in 1959. Another line ofevidence provided by Hillarp concerned the coexis-tence of adenosine 5'-triphosphate （ATP） with cate-cholamines, first in adrenal chromaffin Cells and laterin sympathetic nerves. Inconsistencies in the singletransmitter hypothesis provided by these and otherstudies from the early literature were rationalized inan article by Burnstock in 1976 with the provocativetitle,"Do some nerve cells release more than one trans-mitter？" Today it is widely accepted that cotransmis-sion is an integral feature of neurotransmission.   A role for ATP as a cotransmitter in sympathetic,parasympathetic, sensory-motor, and enteric nonadre-nergic, noncholinergic （NANC） inhibitory nerves wassupported by research from Burnstock and colleagues,while H6kfelt and colleagues focused on the co-localization, vesicular storage, and release of peptidesfrom both peripheral and central nerves.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
