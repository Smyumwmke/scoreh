Second languages are vitally important to diverse groups of people, ranging from refugees to college students facing foreign language requirements. An Introduction to Second Language Acquisition Research provides a synthesis of empirical findings on second and foreign language learning by children and adults. emphasising the desing and execution of appropriate research. The book assumes no prior knowledge of SLA. and introduces major topics such as the scope of SLA research. research methodology for gathering and analysing data, the history and development of SLA research and substantive findings on interlanguage development. explanations for success and failure, the role of theory in social science, current theories of SLA. and the effects of formal instruction on language learning. The volume also includes an extensive bibliography and suggestions for further reading, as well as discussion questions and problems to accompany each chapter. An Introduction to Second Language Acquisition Researc is a comprehensive, yet highly accessible study which will prove invaluable for language teachers and teachers in raining, as well as discusion questions and problems to accompany each chapter. An Introduction to Second Language Acquisition Research is a comprehensive, yet highly accessible study which will prove invaluable for language teachers and teachers in training, as well as students in applied linguistics, linguistics, psychology, psycholinguistics and foreign language education. Diane Larsen-Freeman is a Senior Faculty Member in the MAT Program at the Sehool of International Training.Vermont. USA and Michael H. Long is Professor of English as a Second Language, at the University of Hawaii,USA.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
