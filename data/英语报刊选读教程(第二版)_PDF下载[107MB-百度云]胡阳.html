  25  increasingly vibrant pop scene. Korean singer BoA outsold all Japanese artists in March. Instead of touring Europe, Japanese women these days are just as likely to visit Seoul to have a massage and shop.[4] Meanwhile, Korea's youth, for whom the trendy present is more relevant than the remote past, sop up Japanese exports such as comic books, animated movies 30  and video games. "The Japanese did us wrong in the past," says 20-year-old Lee Ho Yun as she sips a coffee at a Seoul cacatering to Japanese manga and anita6 fans. "That doesn't mean we still have to hate Japan." During the occupation, Japan forced Koreans to take Japanese names, part of an attempt to stamp out Korean identity. Today Lee and her friends adopt Japanese nicknames for fun. She calls 35 herself Izumi, because "it sounds pretty."[5] The increased exchange can in part be ascribed to the easing of government barriers designed to prevent cultural "pollution." Korea banned imports of Japanese movies, music and other material until 1998. That year, Japan's then-Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi signed a written apology for subjugating Koreans, and Korea's40  President Kim Dae Jung agreed to a gradual lifting of the restrictions. Today most Japanese video games and movies can be imported legally. Game console software and songs with Japanese lyrics are still officially banned but are widely available.[6] A stronger reason for cultural drtente is Korea's newfound socioeconomic parity. Even Koreans will admit their lingering resentment is tinged with envy of a45  neighbor that seemed to be so impossibly rich and successful. But in the past several years, the peninsula has come up in the world. Korea's economy is soaring while Japan's stagnates. Korean companies that once copied Japanese electronic gadgets are growing fast and developing global brands. Samsung Electronics earned $2.1 billion last year, more than Sony and the other top five Japanese electronics makers50  combined. Korea had the best-performing stock market in the world in 2001. The country is a leader in its adoption of digital technology. At the end of 2001, more than half of Korea's households were using broadband, compared with less than 5 of Japan's, and the former's prowess at wireless communications rivals the latter's. "Korea is becoming more mature and confident as a nation and Japan is beginning to55  appreciate Korea for its achievements" says Lee Jung Hoon, who teaches Japan-Korean relations at Yonsei University in Seoul. "The momentum is there for a much-improved relationship."</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
