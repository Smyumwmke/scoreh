<p>书名:研究生英语写作.实践.范例</p><p>作者:荀露玲，周军  主编</p><p>页数:170</p><p>定价:¥22.0</p><p>出版社:四川大学出版社</p><p>出版日期:2007-10-01</p><p>ISBN:9787561438602</p><p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>Subsequent to Writing and Practice, this book features a collection of some of our students’ written work combined with careful and insightful comments of a team of senior professors and teachers who have for many years been involved in teaching English writing to research students at the master’s and doctoral levels. We believe that this selection of our students’ original work, inadequate in various aspects yet refreshing in creativity, can dramatically reveal the actual learning experience typical of Chinese students working their way to good English writing. It is our hope that with the expertise of our editorial team dedicated to helping students improve their English writing proficiency, this book that features students’ originality and interactive learning strategy will be able to present to students an opportunity to criticize and draw on their fellows’ work while reflecting on their own, and to invite our academic peers to re-examine the approaches we have been adopting in our teaching of English writing.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
