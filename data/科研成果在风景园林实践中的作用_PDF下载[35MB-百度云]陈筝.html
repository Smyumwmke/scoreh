　　This book was mostly based on Dr. CHEN Zheng s Ph. D. dissertation submitted to Virginia Polytechnic and State University. In this book， Dr. Chen collected data about the production， dissemination and application of research knowledge within the profession of landscape architecture in the United States， and then examined the problems of knowledge accumulation and dissemination.<br/>　　Based the observations above， improving strategies on knowledge accumulation were proposed. Two datasets were collected in this study. One is a survey conducted in 2009 on the educators in  council  of Educators in Landscape Architecture （CELA） concerning their research directions， funding， publication， their understanding of research， etc. . The other is a sampled survey conducted in 2010 on  American Society of Landscape Architects （ASLA）  members concerning their knowledge access and needs， the use of research in everyday work， their understanding of research， etc.. This book provides a holistic scope of the research directions and emerging trends in landscape architecture， as well  as its knowledge dissemination and application， with a target audience from the researchers in landscape architecture and related disciplines.
