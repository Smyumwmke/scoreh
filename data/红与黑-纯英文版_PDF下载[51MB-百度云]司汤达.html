This very different look alarmed Mrs. de Renal greatly. When he saw her later he thought of glory and decided he must hold her hand that evening.　　That night was dark， which would make his job easier. When they sat in the garden， he was full of fear. Every minute was like an hour， until the clock struck ten o'clock. At last he grasped her hand. She pulled back immediately， and surprising himself， he reached and held onto it. She tried to pull back once again， but he held tightly. Her hand stayed in his.　　Happiness filled him-not that he was in love， but that his fear was over！ His voice was loud and even. Mrs. de Renal's voice， however， showed so much feeling that her friend Mrs. Derville thought she was ill. Mrs. Derville said that they should go inside. Julien sensed the danger； "if she goes inside now I will be back in the same terrible situation，" he thought， "I've held this hand for too short a time for this to be a victory."　　When Mrs. Derville repeated her suggestion， Julien squeezed the hand he held firmly. Mrs. de Renal had started to get up， but sat down again. She said， "I do feel a little ill， but the fresh air is helping." These words settled Julien's worries.　　When he woke the next day， he had no thoughts of Mrs. de Renal. He only thought that he had done his duty， his heroic duty. He decided to spend the morning reading about the deeds of his hero， Napoleon. He did not even see the children.　　Julien came downstairs， but instead of a romantic look from Mrs. de Renal， he found the angry face of Mr. de Renal. Mr. de Renal yelled for some time. He did not fire Julien right then only because he feared Mr. Valenod would hire him right away. Julien's anger was so great that even Mrs. Derville tried to calm him.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《床头灯英语·1500词读物》系列丛书由美国作家用常用的英语单词改写而成，涵盖国、内外专家学者力荐的世界名著作品，用基础的词汇细致入微地表述和阐释生活的细节和丰富的内心世界。　　《床头灯英语·1500词读物》系列丛书有英汉对照和纯英文两种版本，重难点之处有注释，章节后有习题巩固，简单易读好坚持。配有语速适中、发音标准的英文朗读音频以及24小时社群贴身答疑服务。　　只需轻轻一扫码，就可获得视听说三位一体的学习体验，仿佛立刻置身英语国家中，是培养阅读习惯、启迪人生智慧、学习英语的不错选择。“床头灯英语”在手，读书难题不再有！</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
