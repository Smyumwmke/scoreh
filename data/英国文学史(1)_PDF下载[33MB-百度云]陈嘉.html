<p>书名:英国文学史(1)</p><p>作者:陈嘉</p><p>页数:329</p><p>定价:¥28.0</p><p>出版社:商务印书馆</p><p>出版日期:1982-07-01</p><p>ISBN:9787100001922</p><p><h2>节选</h2></p>[<p>　　Most of the English romances of the time were metrical， metreand rhyme having been adopted from French poetry to take the placeof alliteration in Anglo-Saxon poetry， but in early 14th centurythere was a curious revival of alliterative verse in a number of romanceswritten in the West Midland dialect of Middle English：　　 The legend of King Arthur and his Round Table knights wasthe most popular theme employed.  The origins of the Arthurianlegend are very complicated and even confusing because there was anArthur as a historical figure（"dux bellorum"， i.e.， "the leader of thewars"） of the Celts in a series of 12 battles to repulse the invading Anglo-Saxons； then there was another Arthur as a mythological figure appear-ing chiefly in Welsh literature as a king of fairy-land， who undertakeshazardous quests， slays monsters， visits the realms ofthe dead and hasa number of knightly henchmen； and finally there was an Arthur as alegendary hero-reported by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his Latin "His-toria Regum Britanniae" （1137）.  In this last book the main frameworkof the now commonly known Arthurian legend is sketched， beginningfrom the prophecies of Merlin and the birth of Arthur， through hismarriage with Guanhumara （Guenevere） and his various conquestsand knightly adventures， to the treachery of his nephew Mordredand his battlewith the latter， and finally to Mordred's defeat andGuen-eyere turniaglnun and Arthur himself mortally wounded and carriedto Avalon.  Geoffrey of Monmouth's hook was translated by morethan one writer into French and then Layamoa， a bumble priest on thebanks of the Severn， told the Arthurian story for the first time in Englishin his alliterative poem with occasional rhymes， "Brut'" （1205）.  Inthe meantime，， inthe late 12th and early 13th centuries the Arthurianlegend became very popular on the European Continent， particularlyin France and Germany， as it was retold with elaborations by German poets Wolfram yon Eschenbach and Gottfried von Strassburg andFrench poets Marie de .France and Chrestien （or Chretien） de Troyes.So that by about 1300 most of the legendary material woven round thestory of King Arthur and his Round Tableknights， from.Merlin and thebirth of Arthur， to Guenevere and the treachery of Mordred and thepassing of Arthur， and including the heroic deeds of the best knownknights like Lancelot and Tristram， Gawain and Percival as well asthe story of the Holy Grail， had all been treated of whether in chronicleor in romance， in verse or in prose， in English or in Welsh or in Latin，French or German. The Arthurian romances written in Englishwere mostly metrical， usually dealing with. once pa.rticular knight oranother， with Tristram and：his 10ve for Iseult， with Ywain and Gawain，with Lancelot and the maid of Astolet，with Percival and the HolyGrail， and with Merlin and Arthur himself， but before the whole storywas gathered together in a continuous thread in Sir Thomas Malory's"Le Morte d'Arthur" in the 15th century， perhaps the most outstandingsingle romance on the Arthurian legend was the anonymous "SirGawain. and the Green Knight"， written in 1360-1370， in alliterativeverse.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　This is an attempt to write a history of English literature admittedly with an innovative approach. The traditional as well as the more modern views in the West on literary movements， schools， traditions and influences in the field of English literature and on individual English authors and their major and minor works are here given due respect and serious consideration， but with the reservation sometimes to differ and occasionally to introduce new and totally contrary judgments from the viewpoint of historical materialism i.e.， the writers and their writings are to be given their proper places in each case in accordance with the roles， healthful or otherwise， that they play in the progress of history， social and literary. Of course，whether or how far have I succeeded in these pages in living up to the theory advanced above awaits judgment from my readers.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
