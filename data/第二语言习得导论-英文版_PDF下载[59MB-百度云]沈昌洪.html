  The term SLA here is employed tor re/erring to me smay on oomL2A and FLA because it is assumed that the underlying process isessentially similar. Wherever necessary, this coursebook will make use ofthe distinction between these two fields.1.7.2  Acquisition versus LearningThe second tricky but also controversial distinction is the onebetween Acquisition and Learning. Krashen and Terrell （1983） define"acquisition" as the product of a "subconscious" process, similar to that ofchildren in learning their L1, and learning as the product of formalteaching, which results in conscious knowledge about the language, but thedistinction cannot be as simple as that.Schmidt （1990） considers the term "subconscious" as an unlikelyproposition, misleading in consciousness research, where it would implytotally without any awareness. In a non-technical sense, the term couldmean "not being aware of having noticed something," which would berelated to a way of learning that takes place while listening to a tape whilesleeping.  Apparently, some evidence shows that people may subconsciouslypick up what they already know, but there is no evidence that new information may be picked up in such a manner. It is commonly accepted that some level of attention is required to notice something, and thatnoticing is crucial in obtaining new information.  Krashen claimed that learning the rules could not lead to an automaticuse of language as in acquisition. Probably, Krashen used the term "subconscious" in a non-technical sense, as the inability to explain whatone knows. In other words, learners may use language forms correctlywithout being able to explain the forms.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
