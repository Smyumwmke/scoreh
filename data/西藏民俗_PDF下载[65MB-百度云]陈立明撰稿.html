For thousands of years, the ethnic groups there have faced unique challenges on the Earth’s Third Pole and formed their own folk customs full of regional and ethnic flavours.     Folk customs form an indispensable part of Tibetan culture and they can be traced back to the prehistoric inhabitants of the plateau. There is a rich variety of cultural relics that still enjoy huge popularity among Tibetans, who observe many folk customs in daily life as simple as food, clothing and general living. The author gives vivid accounts of what ordinary Tibetans will do when a baby is born, how they name their young, how a folk singer brings a smile to everyone’s face at a wedding, and what etiquette and taboos apply to a funeral. Folk beliefs, the Bon religion and Tibetan Buddhism form the spiritual backdrop to life in Tibet. Throughout the year, Tibetans celebrate numerous festivals according to seasonal changes, religious beliefs, or simply for relaxation and enjoyment. They also engage in fascinating games that celebrate skills, bravery and wisdom, making the best use of the natural environment.     Tibetan folk customs and the cultural psychology that derives from such customs are passed down the generations and enhanced by each generation. The distinctive Tibetan folk culture consists of subdivisions created by the many ethnic groups dwelling on the plateau. Such a folk culture reflects the characteristics, aesthetics and spiritual life of the local people.     The author presents a clear picture of Tibetan folk customs with vivid portrayal of the economic, social and cultural aspects of Tibetan life, helping readers gain a better understanding of the origin and lineage of folk customs, and see with their own eyes the long history, course of development and constant renewal of Tibetan history and culture.     With its historical roots, Tibetan folk culture has formed its own system. In addition to animated de*ions, the book also seeks to summarise the cultural features of Tibetan folk customs:     1. Differences in geographical conditions led to varied ways of living and production. The unique natural environment in Tibet provides the basis of its folk cultural perspective, hence the distinctive regional features of Tibetan folk customs;     2. Coinciding with its regional features, Tibetan folk customs display multifaceted yet highly idiosyncratic ethnic features;     3. Through assimilation and absorption of cultures from outside Tibet, the exchange of different cultures among ethnic groups on the plateau, and the reciprocation of religious and secular cultures, Tibetan folk customs also display features of fusion and amalgamation;     4. Tibetan folk culture phenomena result from the accumulation and fusion of cultural elements created by ethnic groups over millenniums. They have been evolving and changing along with social development in historical inheritance. Tibetan folk customs bear strong imprints of time.     This book enriches the academic with the popular while supporting the popular with the academic, revealing the author’s rich knowledge of the field and ability to offer innovative insights.西藏令无数人感到新奇、神秘、向往。千百年来，生活在这里的西藏各族人民，辛勤地耕耘着这块土地，孕育了具有浓郁民族特色与地方特色的民俗。西藏民俗是西藏文化的重要组成部分，历史十分久远。自从有了高原先民的活动，也就有了西藏民俗活动形式。西藏民俗文化内容丰富，民俗文物多姿多彩，饮食、服饰、居住，茶醇酒香，色彩斑斓的西藏生活民俗；诞生礼、取名、婚嫁、丧葬，西藏人生礼仪；民间信仰、苯教信仰、藏传佛教，神圣时空中的西藏信仰民俗；岁时年节、生产节日、宗教节日、娱乐节日、时光轮回中的西藏节日民俗；斗智斗勇怡情益智的西藏游艺竞技，等等。西藏的民俗以及伴随着这些民俗所产生的文化心理内涵，既有代代相沿的纵向传承，又有同代人之间的横向传播。西藏各族人民创造的民俗文化共同构成了多元整一斑斓多姿的西藏民俗文化，体现了青藏高原人们的特有的民族心理、民族性格、民族精神和民族审美情趣，折射出西藏各族人民的精神风貌。本书以亲临现场的笔触，对西藏民俗在经济、社会、文化生活的各个方面归纳梳理，描绘展示了西藏民俗传承的动态过程，反映了西藏民俗与祖国内地和周边国家同类和其他文化事项及其他形式民俗的交流和交融体现了青藏高原民族的生活风情和审美情趣，展示了特有的高原风采，演绎出藏族历史文化的丰厚、变迁、升华。西藏民俗文化源远流长，自成体系。在如临其境的描绘之外，本书特别归纳了西藏民俗的文化特征进行了理论归纳：1）从地理环境的差异决定人们生产生活方式的差异，独特的自然地理环境造就独特西藏民俗文化视角，展示了西藏民俗的地域性特征；2）与其地域性特征一致的前提下，西藏民俗方方面呈现多元整一浓郁的民族性特征；3）西藏民俗对外来文化的兼收并蓄，各民族文化之间、宗教与世俗之间交流相通中呈现出互融性特征；4）西藏民俗文化现象都是青藏高原个民族千百年来创造的文化因子的积淀和熔铸，历史传承中随着社会发展而不断发展和变化，体现了特定的时代性特征。作品以通俗丰富学术，以学术支撑通俗，颇见功力和创新。
