The story of the Trojan War is well known to everyone. Two states are involved into a tedious war for a pretty woman,Helen. The war lasts for almost ten years because the Trojans have a concrete wall which is too solid to be breached. Then, a hero, Odysseus, comes up with the remarkable idea to fashion a tremendous wooden horse and leaves it at the gates of Troy after their fake retreat. The Trojans deem that they are the victors of the war and take the horse into the city as a present from the retreating enemies. However, Greek soldiers stay inside the wooden horse and wait for a chance to initiate a sudden strike. At night, Greek soldiers hiding in the horse sneakily come out and capture the city in a moment.　　(Sentence example: Trojan horses are the major threat of electronic commerce and constantly harm the security of online wealth.)　　(18) Cuttin,g the Gordian Knot means that someone can find a brave,creative solution to settling a complicated problem. King Gordius of Phrygiaties the knot and predicts that a man who can untie it is destined to be the future king of Asia. After many invalid attempts to untie the knot, Alexander,who leads his powerful army on his march through Anatolia,a place in present-day Turkey, reaches the city called Gordium. There, Alexander is shown the prophecy of the chariot of Gordius, the ancient founder of the city. The yoke of the chariot is fastened to a pole by an intricate knot. According to a popular version of this story, Alexander merely cuts courageously through the knot with his sword. Hence, to cut the Gordian knot means to solve a puzzle in a very powerful and decisive manner.　　( Sentence example: The scientist cut the Gordian knot and found an effective method to cure the disease.)　　(19) A Mercurial Disposition, means to describe a sudden or unexpected change in one's mood. Mercury is the Roman name for the Greek god,Hermes. Hermes, who is called the trickster Olympian, has a changeable mind and ever shifting. As a baby, Hermes has the guts to steal the cattle of Apollo and drives them back up a hill to bewilder his followers. When he is finally hunted down by the owner of cattle, Apollo, Hermes pretends to be a frightened child. He is brought to a trial before Zeus, where he confesses the comedic adventure and is granted mercy. At length, he presents Apollo the lyre, which he has invented, and treats him as a close friend.　　(Sentence example: The queen has a Mercurial disposition and nobody can spot her thoughts.)　　(20) Food of the Gods means luscious, unbelievably delicious food.　　Nector is the drink and ambrosia is the food wluch the gods normally ate.If a mortal eats the ambrosia and drinks nectar, he or she will become immortal forever.　　( Sentence example: This hamburger had a fragrant flavor and tasted like the food of the Gods.)　　(21) A Judgment of Paris means a difficult decision. Paris is the Trojan prince, who is assigned to complete the impossible task of deciding which goddess is the most beautiful from Athena, Aphrodite, and Hera. All three goddesses bribe Paris, but for him, Aphrodite's promise is the most tempting.　　She promises to give him the most beautiful mortal woman in the world,whose name is Helen. Paris makes his judgment and selects Aphrodite. The other two goddesses are outraged, and the judgment of Paris brings a devastating disaster to his city, Troy.　　( Sentence example: The students will face a judgment of Paris when they have to choose their future careers after graduation.)　　(22) Dionysiac Frenzy means a state caused by overdrinking which makes one lose the sanity.
