    1604年，莎士比亚已经40岁了，这时，他写出了这部名为“终成眷属”的剧作来。原英语名的原意是：“结局好，一切都好”。这部剧作被收入到1623年的first folio（《**对开本》）里。从写出并上演到**次公开出版，又过了近20年时间。
    这出剧在莎士比亚的全部剧作中，并不是重重要的。但这并不妨碍喜爱莎士比亚的中国读者对这出剧作的欣赏与把玩。《终成眷属》看似喜剧，其实，它更应该为今天的国人所理解。因为，门第观念在古老的中国，一直是个极富挑战的话题。“门当户对”，彼此才能看得顺眼，也因此才能奠定走向幸福的未来的基础。否则，门不当，户不对，则会发现，自己有如《终成眷属》里的海伦娜，成为生活中的笑柄，尽管做出各种努力，但终究逃不过被人揶揄与嘲讽的境地。

      William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 - 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world’s pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England’s national poet and the “Bard of Avon”. His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays, 154t sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, the authorship of some of which is uncertain. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
      Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, later known as the King’s Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare’s private life survive, and there has been considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.
      In the 20th century, his work was repeatedly adopted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular today and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
