  Plagiarism: One of these signs is the fact that the same movement which effected the elevation of what was called the lowest class in the state, assumed in literature a very marked and as benign an aspect. That which had been negligently trodden under foot by those who were harnessing and provisioning themselves for long journeys into far countries, is suddenly found to be richer than all foreign parts. The literature of the poor, the feelings of the child, the philosophy of the street, the meaning of household life, are the topics of the time. It is a great stride. Mthough the second sentence in this paragraph is deleted, this version obviouslyplagiarizes the original passage. The writer neither uses quotation marks to enclosethe original passage nor gives the source from which the original passage comes, thuscreating the impression that this passage is the writer's own work. Plagiarism: One of these signs is the fact that the same movement which effected the elevation of what was called the lowest class in the state, assumed in literature a very marked and as benign an aspect. Instead of the sublime and beautiful, the near, the low, the common, was explored and poetized.That which had been negligently troddenunder foot by those who were harnessing an provisioning themselves for longjourneys into far countries, is suddenly found to be richer than all foreign parts.The literature of the poor, the feelings of the child, the philosophy of the street, themeaning of household life, are the topics of the time. It is a great stride. The writer documents the source and writes the passage in his own words,therefore it is not considered to be plagiarism.5.
