The other day my aunt paid me a visit.She was overjoyed."I got the highe.st mark in the mid—term examination ！ "she said.Don't be surprised ！ My aunt is indeed a student； to be exact， a college stuclent at the age of 45.　　2.Last year， she put aside her private business and signed up for a one—year， full—time management course in a college."This was the wisest decision I have ever made，"she said proudly like a teenage girl.To her， college is always a right place to pick up new ideas， and new ideas always make her feel young.　　3."Compared with the late 70s，" she says， "now college students have many doors." My aunt cannot help but recall her first college experience in 1978 when college doors began to be re—opened after the Cultural Revolution.She was assigned to study engineering despite her desire to study Chinese literature， and a few years later， the government sent her to work in a TV factory.　　4.I was shocked when she first told me how she had no choice in her major and job.Look at us today！ So many doors are open to us！ I believe there have never been such abundant opportunities for self—development as we have today.And my aunt told me that we should reach our goals by grasping all these opportunities.　　5.The first door I see is the opportunity to study different kinds of subjects that interest us.My aunt said she was happy to stucly management， but she was also happy that she could attend lectures on ancient Chinese poetry and on Shakespearean drama As for myself， I am an English major， but I may also go to lectures on history.To me， if college education in the past emphasized specialization， now.it emphasize.s free and well—rounded development of each individual.So all the fine achievements of human civilization are open to us.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《英语演讲与辩论实训教程/国防语言课程系列教材》将演讲与辩论技巧相结合，设置10个单元，每个单元配以不同的主题，辅以演讲/辩论技巧的讲解，将演讲和辩论名篇赏析与学生模仿训练相结合，将演讲和辩论主题与理论和技能学习相结合，通过具体的演讲辞和辩辞讲解，展示理论和技巧的应用。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
