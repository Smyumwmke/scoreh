<p>书名:胶体和表面化学导论 第4版</p><p>作者:D.J.Shaw</p><p>页数:306 页</p><p>定价:¥38.0</p><p>出版社:世界图书出版公司</p><p>出版日期:2000-06-01</p><p>ISBN:9787506247320</p><p><h2>节选</h2></p>[<p>PrefaceThis book has been written to fill a gap in the literature by offering a standard and overall coverage of colloid and surface chemistry intermediate between the brief accounts found in most textbooks of physical chemistry and the comprehensive accounts found in specialized treaties on colloid and/or surface chemistry.In writing the book, I have kept a number of audiences in mind-particularly: university and polytechnic students studying for an honours degree or its equivalent, or commencing a programme of postgraduate research; scientists in industry who desire a broad background in a subject which may have been somewhat neglected during academic training; and those interested in branches of natural science, for whom an understanding of colloid and surface phenomena is essential.The subject matter is, in general, approached from a fundamental angle, and the reader is assumed to possess a knowledge of the basic principles of physical chemistry. Opportunities have also been taken to describe many of the practical applications of this subject. In addition, some numerical problems (with answers) and a list of references for further reading (mainly books and review articles) are given at the end of the book.The general character os this fourth edidion is similar to that of the third edition. The text has been revised and updated throughout, the major change being the extension of Chapter 5 to include a section on the composition and structure of solid surfaces.I wish to thank my colleagues, particularly Dr A.L.Smith, for their many helpful suggestions, and my wife, Ann, for her help in preparing the manuscipt and checking the text.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　D.J.S</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>鉴于一般物理化学教材和有关胶体与表面化学的专著中对胶体和表面化学基本原理论述简单、笼统,本书作者编写了这本教材以填补这一空白。书中详细论述了胶体和表面化学的各个方面,如胶态;动态性质;光学性质;液-气和液-液界面;固-气界面;固-液界面;带电界面;胶体稳定性;流变学;乳液和泡沫。可供大专院校化学系师生及有关科研人员参考。<br/>This book has been written to fill a gap in the literature by offering a standard and overall coverage of colloid and surface chemistry intermediate between the brief accounts found in most textbooks of physical chemistry and the comprehensive accounts found in specialised treatises on colloid and/or surface chemistry. .<br/>In writing the book, I have kept a number of audiences in mind - particularly: university and polytechnic students studying for an honours degree or its equivalent, or commencing a programme of postgraduate research; scientists in industry who desire a broad background in a subject which may have been somewhat neglected during academic training; and those interested in branches of natural science, for whom an understanding of colloid and surface phenomena is essential. ...</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
