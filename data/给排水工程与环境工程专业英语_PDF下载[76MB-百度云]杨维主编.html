One of them is filtration. The water is passed through a filter that consists of a bed of sand or gravel, which removes a large proportion of the solids that might otherwise contaminate the supply. Another process is aeration. Sprays of water are shot into the air, where sunlight and oxygen help kill bacteria and also remove gases with an unpleasant odor or taste; or air is bubbled into or through the water. A third method involves treatment with chemicals, usually chlorine, to kill harmful bacteria. The process is known as chlorination.Part of providing a safe water supply is disposing of liquid and solid wastes. This problem has become acute in recent years not only because of world-wide population growth, but also because of the vast amount of waste created by industrial processes and by the great mountains of trash that are the by-product of increased consumption. A large number of modern drainage systems use the same sewers to dispose of domestic wastes and runoff water from storms. Many of these systems were designed to empty into streams or other bodies of water where nature itself purified the water over a period of time. Now, however, the amount of waste has become so great that many streams and lakes and even the seas have become polluted. More and more treatment plants are being built to purify water before it is released back into the environment. Therefore, the modern trend is to build separate drainage systems for storm runoff and domestic wastes so that the treatment plants do not have to process the runoff water, which is relatively unpolluted.There are a number of different methods by which solid wastes can be removed or rendered harmless. Several of them are ordinarily used in combination in treatment plants. One of the processes is filtration. Anothe</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
